# PyStacks
A CUDA based modular neural network library

# Information â„¹

Likely my final Neural Network repository, I've been working on this neural netork projects for a couple months now. But I've limited by the fact I had a AMD card, so I was stuck to slow CPU based training. 

Now that I have a much faster Nividia card I've modified my previous NumPy and SciPy based [library](https://github.com/TheonlyIcebear/Neural-Net-Framework) to work with tensorflow and cupy. And it's over 100x faster


# Object Detection ðŸ¤–
I stated before that my goal was to create a object detection model based off of a YOLO type architecture. So far I've been able to replicate Yolo V1 to Yolo V3 with somewhat accurate results

Heres a couple showcases:

# Updates ðŸ“°

My previous model was purely sequential, meaning the output from the previous layer would only go straight into the next layer. I've now added both a `ResidualBlock` and a `ConcatBlock` layer which can skip connections. This is very important for feature pyramid architectures.

I've also fixed a couple errors and misconceptions in my code.

I've also added new activation functions, loss functions and schedulers.

The code is also much more optimized, apart from being GPU based.

I plan to add proper documentation soon, but for now just look at the examples
